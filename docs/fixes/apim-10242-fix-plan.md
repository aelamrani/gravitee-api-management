> **Bug:** DEFAULT organization gateway cannot be tagged
> **Severity:** HIGH
> **Generated:** 2026-01-21T14:28:59.682659

## 📋 Summary

Fix the tagging issue for the default organization gateway by correcting the filtering logic and updating configurations.

## 📊 Impact Analysis

The inability to tag the default organization gateway affects the client's ability to manage and filter gateways specific to their environments, potentially exposing all gateways in their environment and causing configuration management issues.

## 🎯 Root Cause Hypothesis

There may be a misconfiguration or a bug in the gateway filtering logic that prevents the default organization gateway from being tagged correctly.

## 🔧 Affected Services

- APIM Management API
- Gateway Filtering Service

## 📝 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: MODIFY

Identify and correct the misconfiguration in the default organization gateway settings.

**Target File:** `path/to/defaultOrganizationConfigFile`

**Details:**
```
Ensure the default organization gateway is configured correctly to allow tagging.
```

### Step 2: MODIFY

Review and fix the gateway filtering logic to ensure it correctly handles the default organization gateway.

**Target File:** `path/to/gatewayFilteringLogicFile`

**Details:**
```
Correct the logic that prevents the default organization gateway from being tagged.
```

### Step 3: MODIFY

Update the GatewayTaggingService test file to include test cases for tagging the default organization gateway.

**Target File:** `path/to/GatewayTaggingServiceTestFile`

**Details:**
```
Ensure the bug fix is covered by automated tests to prevent regression.
```

## ⚠️ Risks

- **MEDIUM:** The fix might introduce new bugs if the filtering logic is not thoroughly tested.
- **MEDIUM:** Changes to the configuration might affect other parts of the system that rely on the default organization settings.
